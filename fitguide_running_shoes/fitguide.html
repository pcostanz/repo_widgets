	<h1>Running Shoe Fit Guide
	</h1>

	  <p>Like any athlete, runners of every level need the proper equipment to keep them safe. The right running shoes can provide comfort, flexibility, and support during your run and can also contribute to a quick recovery afterward. Finding the ideal amount of cushioning and structure for your stride can minimize excessive friction and prevent blisters.</p>

      <p>This guide will help you find the right shoe for you. It will explain the basics of running shoe anatomy and what you should look for in regards to how each component of the shoe fits. It will also explain different styles of running and the types of running shoes that are best suited for each style. </p>

	  <p><b>The Four Essential Factors in Choosing and Keeping a Running Shoe Are:</b></p>

	<h2>1. Fit and Feel
	</h2>

	<div class="grid_4">
		<p style="padding-top: 73px">A running shoe is made up of three basic components: the upper, the midsole, and the outsole. The upper and lining determine how the running shoe feels on your foot while the midsole and outsole combine to cushion and support your stride. Here's a quick look at the components that make up a running shoe and how each should feel on your foot.</p>

	<h2>2. Pronation
	</h2>

	<div class="grid_12">
		<p>The right amount of cushion and pronation control relieves stress on your knees, hips, and ankles, helping you to feel better during your run and recover more quickly. Pronation is how your ankle and foot move from the beginning to the end of each stride. Your arch height most correlates to your pronation needs.</p>

		<div class="grid_12">
		<h3>How to determine your foot arch:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Get the bottom of your foot damp (not dripping, but wet on the entire surface).</li>
			<li>Step on a dry paper bag or another surface like dry concrete that will show your footprint.</li>
			<li>Match your footprint to one of the options below.</li>

	<h2>3. Heel Drop and Footstrike
	</h2>

	<p>A key measurement of any running shoe is the heel-to-toe differential, or heel drop. This can range anywhere from 0 to 16+ mm. The higher the number, the more thickness and cushion in the heel.</p>

	<p>Your footstrike determines the amount of heel cushion you need. Most runners strike heel first and require a conventional running shoe to effectively cushion the impact. Other runners choose to tailor their stride to strike at the midfoot or forefoot. Such a stride requires little to no heel cushion.</p>
